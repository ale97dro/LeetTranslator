<h1>LeetTranslator 0.9</h1>

In this repository you'll find a simple leet translator that allow you to translate plain text to leet.

The Translator use two alphabet:
<ul>
	<li>Light leet: use only some symbols and characters</li>
	<li>Complete leet: use all characters and symbols possible to translate your text</li>
</ul>

<br/>

<h1>GUI Project</h1>

I'm working on this GUI for the project.<br/>
The project's architecture is made with the MVVM pattern and the GUI is totally responsive (I'm working at this time to convert the old architecture and the first draft of the GUI). <br/>
The objective is to provide a fully-featured translator with:
<ul>
	<li> Editor preferences (themes, settings, ...)</li>
	<li> A simple editor to write, translate and copy the results</li>
	<li> A system to save and reload your leet files: this allow to you to save directly the leet files and continue to work on these in a second time</li>
</ul>

At this moment, you can choose between two different theme: Light and Dark. <br/>

Another feature I'd like to implement is the possibility for the user to add his favourite leet version to translate his own files. I'll work on that feature when I'll complete the basic functionalities.<br/>

If you want modify the GUI or try the translator, you can open the project with your version of Visual Studio (I use VS 2017 Community).<br/>
